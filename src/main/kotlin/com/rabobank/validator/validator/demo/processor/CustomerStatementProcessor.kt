    // quick solution to reference check. This is basically a process of throwing sth into memory without care.
    // The reality is that this solution can kneecap the end result as we are using local memory for something we described to be possibly gigabytes in size.
    // Since this reference accounts for quite a bit of the overall data we use, it can become cumbersome in relation to RAM use.
    // In a production setting, this check would move quickly to somewhere we can access quickly, be it a redis instance or even a local file.
    // To reduce the amount of IO in this demo though, i chose to represent a solution like this as it would be the most similar to the approach i would take - use memory.
